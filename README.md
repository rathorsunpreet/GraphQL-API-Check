# GraphQL API Check

Rick and Morty API provided at [link](https://rickandmortyapi.com/) is checked using GraphQL and Katalon Studio. It involves some Groovy scripting to setup custom keywords.

## Installation
Either manually download the project or use the in-built EGit plugin in Katalon Studio to get the project.

## Usage
There are a couple of ways to run test cases / suites, some of them are as follows:

1. Select `Initial Suite` under `Test Suites` and then press the `Run` button to execute the suite.
2. Select Individual test cases such as `Response Body Check` under `Test Cases` and then press the `Run` button.
3. Select any items under `Object Repository` such as `GET GraphQL Ping` and then select `Run` to ping the API and get the results.

## Notes:
You might want to change the email address and user name for the project upon download. This would stop the auto-email reports from getting sent to my Katalon TestOps account upon every test suite execution.
